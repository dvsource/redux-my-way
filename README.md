# Building a Redux lib from Scratch in my way

### From the original API

#### Top-Level Exportsâ€‹

- `createStore(reducer, [preloadedState], [enhancer])`
- `combineReducers(reducers)`
- `applyMiddleware(...middlewares)`
- `bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch)`
- `compose(...functions)`

#### Store API

- <strong>State</strong>
  - `getState()`
  - `dispatch(action)`
  - `subscribe(listener)`
  - `replaceReducer(nextReducer)`

## TODO

#### Basic

- [x] `createStore(reducer, [initialState], [enhancer]): Store`
- [x] `getState(): SState`
- [x] `dispatch(action): void`
- [x] `subscribe(listener): void`
- [x] `reducer(state, action): State`

#### Adavanced

- [x] `combineReducers(...reducers | reducersObj): State`
- [x] `replaceReducer(nextReducer): void`
- [ ] `applyMiddleware(...middlewares)`
- [ ] `bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch)`
- [ ] `compose(...functions)`

## Playground

### Dependancies
